## Steps

1. Document your assumptions
2. Explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem
3. Provide code comments where applicable
4. Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer.
5. Identify any additional data structures you used and justify why you used them.
6. Only provide your best answer to each part of the question.
